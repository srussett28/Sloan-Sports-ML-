It is computed by adding a player's total strokes to an adjustment and dividing by the total rounds played. The adjustment is computed by determining the stroke average of the field for each round played. This average is subtracted from par to create an adjustment for each round. A player accumulates these adjustments for each round played.

Birdie Average (156): The average number of birdies made per round played.

Strokes Gained Total (SG:Total)(02675): The per round average of the number of Strokes the player was better or worse than the field average on the same course & event.

Driving Distance (101): The average number of yards per measured drive. These drives are measured on two holes per round.

Drives are measured to the point at which they come to rest regardless of whether they are in the fairway or not.
